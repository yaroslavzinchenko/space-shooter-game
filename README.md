# Space Shooter Game
I'm new to Unity and I'm exploring the world of gamedev. This is one of my learning projects. I have some simple game ideas in mind that I will try to implement when I finish some beginning projects like this one.  This is a learning project developed by Unity Technologies with all files needed for this project provided. You can get them at Unity official website.
